# RandomBashMusicPlayer
## To play random songs inside your directory from within your terminal!

This is a basic bash script that plays random song files inside the directory you're currently in when calling this file inside your terminal.

It's also possible to add a preferred path to the script from where the music should be played.
When executing the script you'll be first asked if the music should be played from your preferred path.

## Notes

For playing the songs **afplay** is being used & **afinfo** for querying the length of a specific song...
In case you don't have it installed on your system either install it first or use something else instead
